# Business insight from text mining and word frequency calculations
## In this project, I am an analytics consultant to a (i) brand manager, (ii) product manager and (iii) advertising manager. My job is to give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations. Particularly, I am trying to answer following 4 questions through this project:
### 1. The top 5 brands from the forum messages by calculating frequency counts.
### 2. The top 3 brand pairs which get mentioned together the most.
### 3. The 5 most mentioned attributes. Then a list of co-mention of attributes and the top 5 brands I found earlier.
### 4. The most aspirational brand in your data in terms of people actually wanting to buy or own.

#### Brief Summary: There are two scrape scripts. The first to fetch the names of major car companies from the wikipedia page ‘List of automobile manufacturers’. The second to collect ~5000 or more messages posted in Edmunds.com discussion forums on cars. Then I store the results of both scrapers in a clean .csv file. The first file has a list of manufacturers and the second file has three columns: date, userid and message.
